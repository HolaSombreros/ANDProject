# Foodie

## Description
**Foodie** is a recipe application that shares meal ideas among food lovers and passionate chefs. The main idea is to spread knowledge about food culture that does not only feed the stomach, but the soul. Additionally, the application acts like a virtual fridge so our users can manage their kitchen inventory.
